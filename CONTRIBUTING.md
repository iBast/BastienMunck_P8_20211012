To execute the tests we use [PHPUNIT](https://phpunit.de)

The tests folder tree follow the src tree. Once your tests are written you can execute them with the command : 
```console
./bin/phpunit
```

Once your tests passed and your new feature run well, you can :
- Push your work

Your work will be reviewed, if it's approved it will be merge into the main branch and available to the end users.
